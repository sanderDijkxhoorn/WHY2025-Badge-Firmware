    your system defines a struct mallinfo that is incompatible with the
    standard one declared here.  Otherwise, you can include this file
    INSTEAD of your system system <malloc.h>.  At least on ANSI, all

  malloc(size_t n)

  null if no space is available, in which case errno is set to ENOMEM
  on ANSI C systems.

  If n is zero, malloc returns a minimum-sized chunk. (The minimum
  size is 16 bytes on most 32bit systems, and 32 bytes on 64bit
  systems.)  Note that size_t is an unsigned type, so calls with
  arguments that would be negative if signed are interpreted as
  requests for huge amounts of space, which will often fail. The
  maximum supported value of n differs across systems, but is in all
  cases less than the maximum representable value of a size_t.

  The returned pointer may or may not be the same as p. The algorithm
  prefers extending p in most cases when possible, otherwise it
  employs the equivalent of a malloc-copy-free sequence.

  If p is null, realloc is equivalent to malloc.

  If space is not available, realloc returns null, errno is set (if on
  ANSI) and p is NOT freed.

  if n is for fewer bytes than already held by p, the newly unused

  independent_calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t element_size, void* chunks[]);

  independent_calloc is similar to calloc, but instead of returning a
  single cleared space, it returns an array of pointers to n_elements
  independent elements that can hold contents of size elem_size, each
  of which starts out cleared, and can be independently freed,
  realloc'ed etc. The elements are guaranteed to be adjacently
  allocated (this is not guaranteed to occur with multiple callocs or
  mallocs), which may also improve cache locality in some
  applications.

  The "chunks" argument is optional (i.e., may be null, which is
  probably the most typical usage). If it is null, the returned array
  is itself dynamically allocated and should also be freed when it is
  no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array must be of at least
  n_elements in length. It is filled in with the pointers to the
  chunks.

  In either case, independent_calloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and "chunks"
  is null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be freed when it is no longer needed. This can be
  done all at once using bulk_free.

  independent_calloc simplifies and speeds up implementations of many
  kinds of pools.  It may also be useful when constructing large data
  structures that initially have a fixed number of fixed-sized nodes,
  but the number is not known at compile time, and some of the nodes
  may later need to be freed. For example:

  struct Node { int item; struct Node* next; };

  struct Node* build_list() {
    struct Node** pool;
    int n = read_number_of_nodes_needed();
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    pool = (struct Node**)(independent_calloc(n, sizeof(struct Node), 0);
    if (pool == 0) die();
    // organize into a linked list...
    struct Node* first = pool[0];
    for (i = 0; i < n-1; ++i)
      pool[i]->next = pool[i+1];
    free(pool);     // Can now free the array (or not, if it is needed later)
    return first;
  }
*/
void** dlindependent_calloc(size_t, size_t, void**);

/*
  independent_comalloc(size_t n_elements, size_t sizes[], void* chunks[]);

  independent_comalloc allocates, all at once, a set of n_elements
  chunks with sizes indicated in the "sizes" array.    It returns
  an array of pointers to these elements, each of which can be
  independently freed, realloc'ed etc. The elements are guaranteed to
  be adjacently allocated (this is not guaranteed to occur with
  multiple callocs or mallocs), which may also improve cache locality
  in some applications.

  The "chunks" argument is optional (i.e., may be null). If it is null
  the returned array is itself dynamically allocated and should also
  be freed when it is no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array
  must be of at least n_elements in length. It is filled in with the
  pointers to the chunks.

  In either case, independent_comalloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and chunks is
  null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be freed when it is no longer needed. This can be
  done all at once using bulk_free.

  independent_comallac differs from independent_calloc in that each
  element may have a different size, and also that it does not
  automatically clear elements.

  independent_comalloc can be used to speed up allocation in cases
  where several structs or objects must always be allocated at the
  same time.  For example:

  struct Head { ... }
  struct Foot { ... }

  void send_message(char* msg) {
    int msglen = strlen(msg);
    size_t sizes[3] = { sizeof(struct Head), msglen, sizeof(struct Foot) };
    void* chunks[3];
    if (independent_comalloc(3, sizes, chunks) == 0)
      die();
    struct Head* head = (struct Head*)(chunks[0]);
    char*        body = (char*)(chunks[1]);
    struct Foot* foot = (struct Foot*)(chunks[2]);
    // ...
  }

  In general though, independent_comalloc is worth using only for
  larger values of n_elements. For small values, you probably won't
  detect enough difference from series of malloc calls to bother.

  Overuse of independent_comalloc can increase overall memory usage,
  since it cannot reuse existing noncontiguous small chunks that
  might be available for some of the elements.

  large blocks of memory to potentially reduce the system-level memory
  requirements of a program. However, it cannot guarantee to reduce
  memory. Under some allocation patterns, some large free blocks of
  memory will be locked between two used chunks, so they cannot be
  given back to the system.

  The `pad' argument to malloc_trim represents the amount of free
  trailing space to leave untrimmed. If this argument is zero, only
  the minimum amount of memory to maintain internal data structures

/*
  When locks are defined, there is one global lock, plus

  The global lock_ensures that mparams.magic and other unique
  mparams values are initialized only once. It also protects
  sequences of calls to MORECORE.  In many cases sys_alloc requires
  two calls, that should not be interleaved with calls by other
  threads.  This does not protect against direct calls to MORECORE
  by other threads not using this lock, so there is still code to
  cope the best we can on interference.

  Per-mspace locks surround calls to malloc, free, etc.
  By default, locks are simple non-reentrant mutexes.

  Because lock-protected regions generally have bounded times, it is
  OK to use the supplied simple spinlocks. Spinlocks are likely to
  improve performance for lightly contended applications, but worsen
  performance under heavy contention.

  If USE_LOCKS is > 1, the definitions of lock routines here are

/* -----------------------  Chunk representations ------------------------ */

/*
  (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

  The malloc_chunk declaration below is misleading (but accurate and
  necessary).  It declares a "view" into memory allowing access to
  necessary fields at known offsets from a given base.

  Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
  originally described by Knuth.  (See the paper by Paul Wilson
  ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a survey of such
  techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both in the front of
  each chunk and at the end.  This makes consolidating fragmented
  chunks into bigger chunks fast.  The head fields also hold bits
  representing whether chunks are free or in use.

  Here are some pictures to make it clearer.  They are "exploded" to
  show that the state of a chunk can be thought of as extending from
  the high 31 bits of the head field of its header through the
  prev_foot and PINUSE_BIT bit of the following chunk header.

  A chunk that's in use looks like:

   chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           | Size of previous chunk (if P = 0)                             |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |P|
         | Size of this chunk                                         1| +-+
   mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |                                                               |
         +-                                                             -+
         |                                                               |
         +-                                                             -+
         |                                                               :
         +-      size - sizeof(size_t) available payload bytes          -+
         :                                                               |
 chunk-> +-                                                             -+
         |                                                               |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |1|
       | Size of next chunk (may or may not be in use)               | +-+
 mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    And if it's free, it looks like this:

   chunk-> +-                                                             -+

       +- User payload                                                -+
       :                                                               |

                                                                     +-+
  Note that since we always merge adjacent free chunks, the chunks
  adjacent to a free chunk must be in use.

  Given a pointer to a chunk (which can be derived trivially from the
  payload pointer) we can, in O(1) time, find out whether the adjacent
  chunks are free, and if so, unlink them from the lists that they
  are on and merge them with the current chunk.

  Chunks always begin on even word boundaries, so the mem portion
  (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
  thus at least double-word aligned.

  The P (PINUSE_BIT) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
  chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
  bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
  word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
  size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
  The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set, preventing
  access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory. If pinuse is set for
  any given chunk, then you CANNOT determine the size of the
  previous chunk, and might even get a memory addressing fault when
  trying to do so.

  The C (CINUSE_BIT) bit, stored in the unused second-lowest bit of
  the chunk size redundantly records whether the current chunk is
  inuse (unless the chunk is mmapped). This redundancy enables usage
  checks within free and realloc, and reduces indirection when freeing
  and consolidating chunks.

  Each freshly allocated chunk must have both cinuse and pinuse set.
  That is, each allocated chunk borders either a previously allocated
  and still in-use chunk, or the base of its memory arena. This is
  ensured by making all allocations from the `lowest' part of any
  found chunk.  Further, no free chunk physically borders another one,
  so each free chunk is known to be preceded and followed by either
  inuse chunks or the ends of memory.

  Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
  as the prev_foot of the NEXT chunk. This makes it easier to
  deal with alignments etc but can be very confusing when trying
  to extend or adapt this code.

  The exceptions to all this are

     1. The special chunk `top' is the top-most available chunk (i.e.,
        the one bordering the end of available memory). It is treated
        specially.  Top is never included in any bin, is used only if
        no other chunk is available, and is released back to the
        system if it is very large (see M_TRIM_THRESHOLD).  In effect,
        the top chunk is treated as larger (and thus less well
        fitting) than any other available chunk.  The top chunk
        doesn't update its trailing size field since there is no next
        contiguous chunk that would have to index off it. However,
        space is still allocated for it (TOP_FOOT_SIZE) to enable
        separation or merging when space is extended.

     3. Chunks allocated via mmap, have both cinuse and pinuse bits
        cleared in their head fields.  Because they are allocated
        one-by-one, each must carry its own prev_foot field, which is
        also used to hold the offset this chunk has within its mmapped
        region, which is needed to preserve alignment. Each mmapped
        chunk is trailed by the first two fields of a fake next-chunk
        for sake of usage checks.

  Larger chunks are kept in a form of bitwise digital trees (aka
  tries) keyed on chunksizes.  Because malloc_tree_chunks are only for
  free chunks greater than 256 bytes, their size doesn't impose any
  constraints on user chunk sizes.  Each node looks like:

  Each tree holding treenodes is a tree of unique chunk sizes.  Chunks
  of the same size are arranged in a circularly-linked list, with only
  the oldest chunk (the next to be used, in our FIFO ordering)
  actually in the tree.  (Tree members are distinguished by a non-null
  parent pointer.)  If a chunk with the same size an an existing node
  is inserted, it is linked off the existing node using pointers that
  work in the same way as fd/bk pointers of small chunks.

  Each tree contains a power of 2 sized range of chunk sizes (the
  smallest is 0x100 <= x < 0x180), which is is divided in half at each
  tree level, with the chunks in the smaller half of the range (0x100
  <= x < 0x140 for the top nose) in the left subtree and the larger
  half (0x140 <= x < 0x180) in the right subtree.  This is, of course,
  done by inspecting individual bits.

  Using these rules, each node's left subtree contains all smaller
  sizes than its right subtree.  However, the node at the root of each
  subtree has no particular ordering relationship to either.  (The
  dividing line between the subtree sizes is based on trie relation.)
  If we remove the last chunk of a given size from the interior of the
  tree, we need to replace it with a leaf node.  The tree ordering
  rules permit a node to be replaced by any leaf below it.

  The smallest chunk in a tree (a common operation in a best-fit
  allocator) can be found by walking a path to the leftmost leaf in
  the tree.  Unlike a usual binary tree, where we follow left child
  pointers until we reach a null, here we follow the right child
  pointer any time the left one is null, until we reach a leaf with
  both child pointers null. The smallest chunk in the tree will be
  somewhere along that path.

  The worst case number of steps to add, find, or remove a node is
  bounded by the number of bits differentiating chunks within
  bins. Under current bin calculations, this ranges from 6 up to 21
  (for 32 bit sizes) or up to 53 (for 64 bit sizes). The typical case
  is of course much better.

/* ----------------------------- Segments -------------------------------- */

/*
  Each malloc space may include non-contiguous segments, held in a
  list headed by an embedded malloc_segment record representing the
  top-most space. Segments also include flags holding properties of
  the space. Large chunks that are directly allocated by mmap are not
  included in this list. They are instead independently created and
  destroyed without otherwise keeping track of them.

  Segment management mainly comes into play for spaces allocated by
  MMAP.  Any call to MMAP might or might not return memory that is
  adjacent to an existing segment.  MORECORE normally contiguously
  extends the current space, so this space is almost always adjacent,
  which is simpler and faster to deal with. (This is why MORECORE is
  used preferentially to MMAP when both are available -- see
  sys_alloc.)  When allocating using MMAP, we don't use any of the
  hinting mechanisms (inconsistently) supported in various
  implementations of unix mmap, or distinguish reserving from
  committing memory. Instead, we just ask for space, and exploit
  contiguity when we get it.  It is probably possible to do
  better than this on some systems, but no general scheme seems
  to be significantly better.

  Management entails a simpler variant of the consolidation scheme
  used for chunks to reduce fragmentation -- new adjacent memory is
  normally prepended or appended to an existing segment. However,
  there are limitations compared to chunk consolidation that mostly
  reflect the fact that segment processing is relatively infrequent
  (occurring only when getting memory from system) and that we
  don't expect to have huge numbers of segments:

  * Segments are not indexed, so traversal requires linear scans.  (It
    would be possible to index these, but is not worth the extra
    overhead and complexity for most programs on most platforms.)
  * New segments are only appended to old ones when holding top-most
    memory; if they cannot be prepended to others, they are held in
    different segments.

  Except for the top-most segment of an mstate, each segment record
  is kept at the tail of its segment. Segments are added by pushing
  segment records onto the list headed by &mstate.seg for the
  containing mstate.

  Segment flags control allocation/merge/deallocation policies:
  * If EXTERN_BIT set, then we did not allocate this segment,
    and so should not try to deallocate or merge with others.
    (This currently holds only for the initial segment passed
    into create_mspace_with_base.)
  * If USE_MMAP_BIT set, the segment may be merged with
    other surrounding mmapped segments and trimmed/de-allocated
    using munmap.
  * If neither bit is set, then the segment was obtained using
    MORECORE so can be merged with surrounding MORECORE'd segments
    and deallocated/trimmed using MORECORE with negative arguments.

/* ---------------------------- malloc_state ----------------------------- */

/*
   A malloc_state holds all of the bookkeeping for a space.
   The main fields are:

  Top
    The topmost chunk of the currently active segment. Its size is
    cached in topsize.  The actual size of topmost space is
    topsize+TOP_FOOT_SIZE, which includes space reserved for adding
    fenceposts and segment records if necessary when getting more
    space from the system.  The size at which to autotrim top is
    cached from mparams in trim_check, except that it is disabled if
    an autotrim fails.

  Designated victim (dv)
    This is the preferred chunk for servicing small requests that
    don't have exact fits.  It is normally the chunk split off most
    recently to service another small request.  Its size is cached in
    dvsize. The link fields of this chunk are not maintained since it
    is not kept in a bin.

  SmallBins
    An array of bin headers for free chunks.  These bins hold chunks
    with sizes less than MIN_LARGE_SIZE bytes. Each bin contains
    chunks of all the same size, spaced 8 bytes apart.  To simplify
    use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts as a malloc_chunk
    pointing to the real first node, if it exists (else pointing to
    itself).  This avoids special-casing for headers.  But to avoid
    waste, we allocate only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use
    repositioning tricks to treat these as the fields of a chunk.

  TreeBins
    Treebins are pointers to the roots of trees holding a range of
    sizes. There are 2 equally spaced treebins for each power of two
    from TREE_SHIFT to TREE_SHIFT+16. The last bin holds anything
    larger.

  Bin maps
    There is one bit map for small bins ("smallmap") and one for
    treebins ("treemap).  Each bin sets its bit when non-empty, and
    clears the bit when empty.  Bit operations are then used to avoid
    bin-by-bin searching -- nearly all "search" is done without ever
    looking at bins that won't be selected.  The bit maps
    conservatively use 32 bits per map word, even if on 64bit system.
    For a good description of some of the bit-based techniques used
    here, see Henry S. Warren Jr's book "Hacker's Delight" (and
    supplement at http://hackersdelight.org/). Many of these are
    intended to reduce the branchiness of paths through malloc etc, as
    well as to reduce the number of memory locations read or written.

  Segments
    A list of segments headed by an embedded malloc_segment record
    representing the initial space.

  Address check support
    The least_addr field is the least address ever obtained from
    MORECORE or MMAP. Attempted frees and reallocs of any address less
    than this are trapped (unless INSECURE is defined).

  Magic tag
    A cross-check field that should always hold same value as mparams.magic.

  Max allowed footprint
    The maximum allowed bytes to allocate from system (zero means no limit)

  Flags
    Bits recording whether to use MMAP, locks, or contiguous MORECORE

  Statistics
    Each space keeps track of current and maximum system memory
    obtained via MORECORE or MMAP.

  Trim support
    Fields holding the amount of unused topmost memory that should trigger
    trimming, and a counter to force periodic scanning to release unused
    non-topmost segments.

  Locking
    If USE_LOCKS is defined, the "mutex" lock is acquired and released
    around every public call using this mspace.

  Extension support
    A void* pointer and a size_t field that can be used to help implement
    extensions to this malloc.
